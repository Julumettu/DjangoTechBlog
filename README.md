# DjangoTechBlog
Project files for Django based TechBlog I am developing to use as a sort of virtual CV.

Eventually this project should have enough content for anyone to copy this project to deploy simple blog with ready User implementation and ways to push blog-text using the Admin-page.

To-do:

- API views to make pushing data to website with xml/json format could be nice
- Somekind of way to "publish" blog-posts so that they will not be added right away would make it easier to add blog-posts without interfering with current usage
- Some modifications for default Users for Administration/Publisher might be neat idea to study.
